# Mock-JSON-API-Maker
Mock JSON API is a Docker image that provides a simple JSON API for testing and development purposes. It can be used to simulate a backend service that responds with a JSON payload. Simply specify the JSON response you want to return when starting the container, and you can access the API at the exposed port.
